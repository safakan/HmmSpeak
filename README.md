# HmmSpeak for VAM 6 week program, ai app idea building

HmmSpeak is an app helping people practice speaking skills in a new language with other people in real time. To use the app users will open it, click start and continue their conversation. If they ever get stuck within their conversation they can have a look on the screen. The screen will contain related words (lists of nouns, adjectives, verbs) and ai response. Stuck user who is troubling to form sentences can use the listed words and try to form a sentence. If not they can repeat what the ai response is saying to the person next to them and the conversation can continue.

Recording > Transcribe > Conversation Document > LLM > output data: {
    ai_response: String(ai_response),
    nouns: List[nouns],
    adjectives: List[adjectives],
    verbs: List[verbs],
}
